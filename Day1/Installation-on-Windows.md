To install Go (Golang) on Windows, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Download the Installer
1. Go to the [Go Downloads page](https://go.dev/dl/).
2. Download the Windows `.msi` installer for the latest version of Go.

### Step 2: Run the Installer
1. After downloading, run the `.msi` installer.
2. Follow the installation instructions. By default, Go will be installed in `C:\Go`.

### Step 3: Set Go Environment Variables (Optional)
The installer should automatically set your `PATH` environment variable to include `C:\Go\bin`, but you can manually verify or update it if needed:
1. Right-click on "This PC" or "Computer" and select **Properties**.
2. Click on **Advanced system settings** and then on the **Environment Variables** button.
3. Under "System variables," find the `Path` variable, select it, and click **Edit**.
4. Ensure `C:\Go\bin` is listed. If not, add it to the variable value.

### Step 4: Verify Installation
1. Open a new Command Prompt or PowerShell window and run:

   ```bash
   go version
   ```

2. You should see the Go version installed, like:

   ```
   go version go1.21.1 windows/amd64
   ```

BOOM, Now you're all set to write and run Go programs on Windows!
