To install Go (Golang) on macOS, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Download Go
1. Open Terminal.
2. Download the latest Go binary for macOS using the following command (you can check the latest version on the [official Go website](https://go.dev/dl/)):

   ```bash
   wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.21.1.darwin-amd64.tar.gz
   ```

### Step 2: Extract Go
3. Extract the downloaded tarball and move it to `/usr/local`:

   ```bash
   sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.21.1.darwin-amd64.tar.gz
   ```

### Step 3: Set Up Go Environment Variables
4. Add Go's bin directory to your `PATH` so that you can use Go commands from anywhere:

   ```bash
   echo "export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin" >> ~/.bash_profile
   ```

   If you are using `zsh` (the default shell on macOS Catalina and later), add the line to `~/.zshrc` instead:

   ```bash
   echo "export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin" >> ~/.zshrc
   ```

5. Reload your terminal configuration:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bash_profile  # or ~/.zshrc if using zsh
   ```

### Step 4: Verify Installation
6. Check if Go is installed correctly by running:

   ```bash
   go version
   ```

   You should see the installed Go version, such as:

   ```
   go version go1.21.1 darwin/amd64
   ```

BOOm, Now you're ready to start developing in Go on macOS!
